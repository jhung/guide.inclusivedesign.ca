            Insights</header><h1>Autonomous User</h1><p>Allowing for personal discovery of needs and preferences is an important aspect of inclusive design. If an individual has never been exposed to something (e.g. changing settings on a digital device, or alternative learning or teaching methods), it is not enough to ask - what works for you? That is, if someone is unaware of an available solution, there is no way for that individual to know that it will help them, or to know where to find it or even to be motivated to to seek it out.</p>
            <p>Designing for playful and engaging discovery in a low-risk environment creates a space for a user to learn about their own needs and preferences. In contrast, prescribing ways of interacting or learning based on medical diagnoses or other rigid categorizations or assumptions limits a user’s choices and makes no space for the unexpected or for variations and nuances.</p>
            <p>Wherever possible adaptability and flexibility should be designed into products and services. This puts more power into the hands of any one of us to create our own experience, and to modify this experience over time and/or in new contexts. Allowing for the sharing of information among users is another way to promote user autonomy; in this way an individual can depend on a growing community of people with similar interests and needs.</p>

            <h2 id="try">Try</h2>
            <p>Record three examples of an experience of mismatch that you’ve had, no matter how large or small. For example - standing at an automated bank machine in the glare of the sun, I couldn’t see the screen at all. How did you feel when this happened? What did you do about it? How could the design of the product or service be modified to meet your needs?</p>

            Insights</header><h1>Diverse Participation and Perspectives</h1><p>In keeping with the edict “nothing about us without us”, this principle is about inviting a diversity of people with a broad range of needs, preferences, interests and skills into the design process, and in so doing, weakening the distinction between user and designer. Considering inclusion in all aspects and at all stages of the design process requires that our communication methods, group processes and daily interactions are inclusive. This helps to ensure that the products and services that are created will be more inclusive.</p>
            <p>To support diverse participation and enable the design to be as closely linked as possible to the application, the design and development tools should be as accessible and usable as possible. Those new to the process must be provided with the information and resources to fully participate (e.g. by being given time to observe and become familiar with the community, culture, collective knowledge and processes). Communication methods should be transparent and multimodal, and design considerations for “alternative” modes of interaction should be given equal weight.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This does not denigrate the skills of professional designers but calls for those skills to become more accessible and for the design process to become more inclusive of diverse designers and consumers. The role of the professional designer expands to include the responsibility for ensuring diverse participation and for ensuring that diverse voices are heard.</p>
            <h2 id="try">Try</h2>
            <p>Make a list of the methods of communication used in your everyday life (meetings, informal discussions, video conferences, phone calls, social media, emails, etc.). Identify some possible barriers that might prevent some from participating in that communication. Consider your own challenges with these processes or those of someone you know.</p>

            <h2 id="try">Try</h2>
            <p>Consider moments of increased self-awareness in your life when a preference, like and dislike, or a need became clear to you. Was it a time when you were forced to adapt to a new situation? For example, while travelling, you slept in a different bed and discovered that a different kind of pillow helped with your neck pain? Or perhaps it was a time when someone offered you a new choice that you hadn’t been exposed to before. What aspects of the situation, environment, or the thing itself helped you to feel comfortable to try something new?</p>
