*Note:* The print feature is still experimental. Please give feedback to the
[fluid-work mailing list](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Mailing+Lists),
or to the [fluid-work IRC channel](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/IRC+Channel).

Before printing, use print preview and print some test pages to ensure all
content is visible. If there are problems, refer to the
[Print Troubleshooting section in the README](http://github.com).

TODO: Fix the github link.

## Printing Tips

Configure the printer settings (not all of these features may be present for
your printer):

* Page orientation set to Landscape.
* Disable "scale to fit" or any "fit to page" feature.
* Enable duplex printing if available. Otherwise print odd pages first, then
manually print even pages on the reverse side.
* If there is a print binding edge, set it to the short edge.
* Set print margins to as small as possible.
